# My proposal for my undergraduate thesis in architecture for a blockchain-based business model. Foundational Document of e-Bitcoin: Design of a Decentralized Electronic Ecosystem for Industrial and Financial Services with Blockchain Anchoring
e-Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic ecosystem designed to provide industrial and financial services anchored to the Bitcoin network. It introduces interoperability, a universal time system, deterministic ordering, and verifiable future planning, solving structural limitations of electronic money and blockchain systems.

Abstract — e-Bitcoin

In this document, I present e-Bitcoin as a technological architecture designed to resolve structural limitations that remain unsolved in contemporary blockchain networks and electronic money systems. The purpose of this text is to define the conceptual, technical, and operational scope of the system the reader is about to examine.

The central problem addressed is the lack of interoperability among blockchain networks and heterogeneous technological systems, primarily caused by the absence of a single, verifiable, and universal time system capable of coordinating events, processes, and states in a deterministic manner. This deficiency prevents global ordering of requests, verifiable future planning, and reliable synchronization across digital infrastructures.

Additionally, e-Bitcoin addresses unresolved problems of electronic money: the inability to simultaneously achieve decentralization, security, and scalability (the blockchain Trilemma), double spending, and the double electronic document problem, understood as structural failures in the management of value and verifiable digital information.

The system introduces an integrated solution that enables ordering and prioritization of requests within blockchain environments—including dynamics such as the mempool—allows verifiable future planning of events and block creation at specific and provable points in time, and secures industrial processes through immutable cryptographic records. Furthermore, e-Bitcoin incorporates an artificial intelligence assistant as a cognitive layer that reduces global adoption barriers by facilitating secure usage, understanding, and interaction with blockchain networks.

Finally, e-Bitcoin establishes a key-to-key communication and universal verification model anchored to the Bitcoin network, positioning itself not only as an electronic money system, but as a global infrastructure for order, time, and consensus.

Introduction to the Services and Functions of the e-Bitcoin Network

In this section, I present— in a structured and comprehensible manner— the fundamental services and functions that constitute the e-Bitcoin network.
Before entering into deep technical descriptions, layered architectures, or consensus mechanisms, I consider it essential to clearly define the functional scope of the system.

The e-Bitcoin network is not an isolated blockchain nor a speculative asset, but rather a decentralized electronic ecosystem of services designed to solve real problems that persist across current blockchain, financial, and industrial infrastructures.
For this reason, the initial focus is not on how the system is built, but on what capabilities it offers, which problems it solves, and which functions it makes available to the world.

The services described below form the operational foundation of e-Bitcoin and define its purpose as a global technological infrastructure for electronic money, document certification, temporal synchronization, process verification, and system interoperability.

Services and Functions of the e-Bitcoin Network

1. Electronic Monetary Services

The e-Bitcoin network incorporates a multi-currency electronic monetary system, designed to eliminate the double-spending problem and enable stable, verifiable, and scalable economic operations.

1.1 eUSD

Electronic money with a stable value, referenced to a globally accepted monetary unit.

Backed by fiat money, real wealth, or verifiable revenues generated by the e-Bitcoin ecosystem itself.

Used as a unit of account, value reference, and backing instrument for other electronic assets.

Not imposed as a single stable currency, but rather as a functional reference within a flexible system.


1.2 eBTC

Electronic money oriented toward global and local electronic payments.

Backed by eUSD, fiat money, or other electronic monetary instruments.

Designed to absorb the operational load that Bitcoin is not intended to handle directly, without competing with its role as a base asset or trust anchor.


1.3 Other Electronic Currencies

Additional electronic instruments that function as exchange pairs within the network.

Always interoperable with eBTC and eUSD.

Their purpose is operational and accounting-based, not speculative.



---

2. Document Certification and Verification Services

The e-Bitcoin network solves the double electronic document problem through a dedicated certification system.

2.1 Hash Paper

A structured digital document containing information, processes, contracts, code, or records.

Represents the single, verifiable version of an electronic document.


2.2 Hash Paper Pool Service (HPPS)

A service of the e-Bitcoin network that allows Hash Papers to be anchored to blockchain networks.

Uses the hash of a blockchain transaction as irrefutable proof of existence, integrity, and verification.

The resulting hash is linked to the corresponding Hash Paper within the e-Bitcoin ecosystem.



---

3. Information Storage Services

The e-Bitcoin network does not impose a single storage model, but instead provides flexibility based on user needs.

3.1 e-Bitcoin Decentralized Storage

Used for critical or high-relevance Hash Papers.

Allows documents and processes to remain on-chain as publicly verifiable references.


3.2 Client Off-Chain Storage

Clients may choose their own storage solutions: private servers, institutional infrastructure, or external systems.

The e-Bitcoin network retains only the verification hash, ensuring integrity without exposing content.



---

4. Universal Time by Consensus (TUC) Services

The e-Bitcoin network incorporates a system of objective and verifiable universal time.

TUC provides a single temporal reference for events, documents, payments, and processes.

Eliminates temporal ambiguities between distributed systems.

Enables precise coordination among monetary, documentary, and industrial services.

Constitutes the temporal foundation upon which the entire ecosystem operates.



---

5. Blockchain Anchoring Services

The e-Bitcoin network uses public blockchains as anchors of truth, not as indiscriminate storage systems.

Minimal transactions are executed solely to obtain an immutable and verifiable hash.

Anchoring can be performed on Bitcoin or other suitable blockchain networks.

The hash serves as a public reference independent of the e-Bitcoin network itself.



---

6. Assisted Artificial Intelligence Services

The e-Bitcoin network integrates an artificial intelligence agent known as HANBOT Asiste.

Designed to operate as a technical assistant of the ecosystem, not as a central authority.

Based on decentralized, open-source, and auditable models.

Facilitates system operation, understanding, and adoption by users, enterprises, and institutions.

Acts as the human-system interaction layer and continuous operational support mechanism.

Preamble

What you are about to read is organized into chapters that describe the order in which e-Bitcoin is built. Each chapter presents a component or principle of the system according to its technical dependencies and structural priority, so the reader can understand not only what e-Bitcoin is, but how it can be implemented step by step.

These chapters are the project’s descriptive and functional layer: they explain what each module is, how it works, its characteristics, and which problem it solves within the ecosystem.

Later, a separate document will be presented containing the technical and code specifications, written as manifestos and protocols, where the formats, rules, interfaces, and implementation requirements needed to build e-Bitcoin in a verifiable and standardized way are defined.

The artificial intelligence model is presented as the final component because it is not required for e-Bitcoin’s core infrastructure to function. However, I recommend implementing it from the beginning, because it accelerates adoption, improves ecosystem operations, reduces errors, and enables education and correct use of the network from day one.


**The double-time problem.**  
**A solution for interoperability in technology.**

# Chapter 1 — TUC: Universal Time by Consensus

## Introduction

This chapter answers two foundational questions that define the problem space for TUC. It explains why the lack of a solution to double time becomes the root cause of interoperability failures across technologies, and it establishes the conceptual framework that justifies TUC as a universal standard for time measurement and temporal ordering.

## What is double time?

Double time occurs when two or more systems that communicate do not share the same time reference. As a result, they may record the same fact with different timestamps, or they may be unable to establish a single, unique order of events.

In practice, one system timestamps an event using its own time settings (time zone, clock discipline, configuration), while the other system interprets or logs that same event using a different time reference or a different logging rule. This produces confusion about *when* something happened, and it can also create situations where two events appear to occur at the same time because there is no universal criterion to break ties and enforce deterministic ordering.

## What is the interoperability problem in technologies?

The interoperability problem in technologies is the inability of different systems (industrial, financial, blockchain, or any software) to operate together under a shared common standard—so that what one system records, interprets, and validates can be understood and verified by another without ambiguous translations or human arbitration.


My True and Real Story 

I imagine myself standing in the middle of an infinite three-dimensional space. There are no edges, no walls, no “here” and “there” defined by anything. There is only space, without end. And that is where everything begins.

I am an architect in training, and my thesis forced me to ask uncomfortable questions: what is architecture really when you remove the traditional setting? What do you design when space itself gives you no limits? At that point I understood something that, to me, is irrefutable: architecture is not only point A or point B. The most important thing is the path between them. The path A→B is where the real experience happens—where perception, memory, and meaning are built.

What is common today is to prioritize the design of point A and point B. People design the origin and the destination as objects. But the path is left without intention. And when the path is not designed, movement becomes boring, empty, and unimportant. For me, that is an error in judgment: the path is the most important architectural space.

When I take that position, I inevitably reach another conclusion: if the path is what matters, then you need references. You need a system that allows you to locate yourself, measure progress, interpret direction, recognize where you are, and understand how far you are from arriving. In an infinite three-dimensional space, without references, there is no “real” path; there is only movement without a frame. By logic, everything that moves needs points of reference in order to exist with meaning.

That was when my obsession began to grow. Because I could not assimilate infinity. It consumed me. I spent many months with that idea inside me, turning it over and over, unable to close the concept in my mind. The problem was not academic; it was mental: how do you understand a space that never ends?

Until one day I resolved it in a way that, for me, was brutally simple. I told myself: if space is infinite, it still has to be filled with something. It cannot be “nothing.” There must be a universal characteristic present throughout the entire infinity. And then I saw it clearly: that “something” is time.

The moment I accepted that, the weight I carried disappeared. Because at last infinite three-dimensional space had an irrefutable foundation: time is everywhere. No matter where you are, time is happening. It is pulsing. It is marking presence. It is a constant.

And then I defined time, for myself, as a constant pulse. Not as a nice clock, and not as a cultural convention, but as a phenomenon that can be understood as a sequence: pulse after pulse after pulse. A repetition. A rhythm. Something that exists even if you have no walls, even if you have no coordinates, even if you have no limits.

After that, the only logical step was to analyze the rhythm of that pulse. If time is a pulse, then what matters is frequency: how fast it occurs, how it is measured, how it is discretized, how it becomes an operational unit. Because that is where it stops being only philosophy and becomes a system.

That was the point at which my project was formally born: TUC, Time Universal by Consensus.

I understood that the problem is not that time exists. The problem is that technologies do not share the same time. Each system lives inside its own clock, its own reference, its own interpretation. And that creates conflicts: conflicts of coordination, event ordering, verification, and communication between technologies. In blockchain networks this problem is obvious, because everything depends on the order of what happens. But my vision was never to limit it only to blockchain: this is a problem of the technology of the entire world, especially in the Internet of Things, where thousands or millions of devices must agree on what happened, when it happened, and in what order it happened.

My hypothesis is simple: the lack of a common time generates communication conflicts. And my solution is just as direct: to create a time that does not depend on an individual clock, but on consensus.

That is where blockchain enters as a tool. Because blockchain is not only “coins”; blockchain is a mechanism for consensus and verification. And if you can use consensus to agree on “what happened” and leave immutable evidence of it, then you can also use consensus to agree on “in which pulse of the present it happened.”

That is why I speak of a TUC block and a threshold of the present: a way to register pulses and to order events with a temporal framework that is verifiable, common, and shared. What I seek is a time format that is not “my clock versus your clock,” but a universal time that exists because all participants agree on it and can verify it.

That is how TUC is born: not as a technological whim, but as the logical consequence of a radical architectural question about infinity, the path, and the human—and technological—need for references.

That is my world.

## **Chapter 1 — Point 1**

### **Infinite Constant Pulsations (Theoretical Framework)**

---

### **1.0 Purpose and Scope**

#### **1.0.1 What I intend to demonstrate in this point**

I, **Lerry Alexander Elizondo Villalobos (byLAEV)**, establish here the **theoretical framework** that supports my proposal: the idea of **synchronized infinite constant pulsations** as a universal way to order and measure the unfolding of events.

This Point 1 has a concrete objective: to **define and justify** why a “pulsation” model—**constant, repeatable, verifiable, and potentially synchronizable**—is a more robust foundation than the traditional notion of “date/time” for building technological systems that require temporal coordination.

#### **1.0.2 What is not addressed yet**

In this point I do **not** develop any implementation, architecture, layer model, block structure, thresholds, future windows, operational calendars, governance, or network mechanisms. Everything related to “how it is operationalized” is reserved for **Point 2**. Here I present only the theory and its postulates.

---

### **1.1 How time works today (current technological view)**

#### **1.1.1 Time as measurement: clocks, timestamps, and imperfect synchronization**

In modern practice, technological time is represented as **measurement**: physical clocks, logical clocks, periodic signals, counters, and **timestamps**. These systems produce temporal markers intended to describe “when something happened.”

However, real infrastructure operates with **inevitable misalignments**: oscillator drift, network latency, jitter, losses, reordering, and reference differences across systems. This means two observers can assign different temporal marks to the same event, even if both believe they are measuring “the same time.”

#### **1.1.2 Why “measuring time” is not the same as “having a common time”**

Measuring time produces a local reading; having a common time requires **consensus** about the order and/or correspondence of measurements. In distributed systems, what matters is not the elegance of a clock, but the ability to **compare** marks across heterogeneous actors without ambiguity.

The baseline conclusion is: **local precision does not guarantee global coherence**.

#### **1.1.3 Consequences in technological networks and distributed systems**

When there is no shared temporal pattern, a transversal problem appears: **ambiguity of occurrence**.

- What happened first if clocks disagree?  
- What does “at the same time” mean between nodes with different latencies?  
- How do I audit a process if records are not strictly orderable under a universal criterion?

This Point 1 begins from that observation: traditional time is sufficient for local use, but insufficient when **globally verifiable order** is required.

---

### **1.2 My conceptual framework: infinite three-dimensional space**

#### **1.2.1 Infinite three-dimensional space as the baseline scenario**

The origin of my idea (LAEV) comes from a conceptual exercise: I imagine myself at the **center of an infinite three-dimensional space**, with no privileged external references. In that scenario, nothing “tells” me where the system begins or ends, because the frame is unlimited.

That exercise forces me to separate two things that are usually confused:

- the **stage** where events occur (space),  
- and the **rhythm** by which events become distinguishable as a sequence (time).

#### **1.2.2 Time as a constant field: the continuous flow that does not stop**

In my framework, time is not an object that “appears” when there are events. Time is a **constant field**: it exists regardless of the density of occurrences. The universe can be “empty” of events relevant to me, yet the temporal field continues.

What varies is not time; what varies is the **occupation of time by events**.

#### **1.2.3 What changes is not time: events, trajectory, and density of occurrences change**

If the stage is infinite, then the reference cannot depend on a location, a time zone, a local authority, or an isolated clock. What I can measure with practical utility is not “absolute time,” but the **regularity of a pattern** that allows ordering of events.

That is why my focus shifts from “date/time” to “rhythm”: a constant rhythm is a more neutral base.

#### **1.2.4 Slow-motion analogy: constant time, variable facts**

A metaphor I use (and I sign as my idea) is slow motion: a camera can record at different rates, but the underlying phenomenon does not change. Thus, measurements can distort perception, while the temporal field maintains continuity.

This analogy is not intended as physics; it is editorial and conceptual: to **separate the constancy of time from the variability of events**.

---

### **1.3 Origin of the idea: pulsation as a universal unit**

#### **1.3.1 Why a constant pulse is more fundamental than a date/time**

A date/time is a **cultural and administrative label**. A constant pulse is a **repeatable counting unit**. The difference is critical: labels depend on conventions; pulses depend on **regularity**.

I propose that, as a theoretical base, the pulse is more fundamental because:

- it can repeat indefinitely,  
- it can be counted without external semantics,  
- it can serve as a building block for higher units without “interpretation.”

#### **1.3.2 Pulsation as a repeatable mark independent of location**

In my definition, a pulsation is a **discrete mark** of a continuous pattern. It does not depend on a place, a civil calendar, or an authority. It depends on the existence of a **periodic** phenomenon and on multiple observers being able to agree on its count.

Location-independence is the structural requirement: if my temporal base depends on “where I am,” I have already lost universality.

#### **1.3.3 Premise: if identical pulsers exist in a distributed setting, their pattern is universal**

My theoretical premise (LAEV) is: if multiple observers possess equivalent pulsers and can verify their constancy, then the pulsation pattern is a candidate for a **universal reference**.

I do not claim here how it is verified in a real network. I only state the principle: **universality arises from the pattern, not from the observer**.

---

### **1.4 Synchronization theory: synchronized constant pulsations**

#### **1.4.1 What it means to synchronize pulsations**

Synchronizing pulsations, in a theoretical sense, means different observers can:

1. recognize the same type of pulse, and  
2. align pulse counting under a shared criterion.

It is not necessary to assume “a single clock.” It is sufficient that a conceptual procedure exists such that the pulse becomes **comparable**.

#### **1.4.2 Stability condition: repetition, constancy, and verifiability**

For a pulsation system to be useful as a temporal base, it must meet three conditions:

- **Repetition:** the pulse must always occur.  
- **Constancy:** its interval must be stable enough not to break counting.  
- **Verifiability:** some (theoretical) criterion must exist to detect deviations.

In this Point 1, “verifiability” is a logical requirement, not an implementation recipe.

#### **1.4.3 Synchronization as the basis for order and coordination among observers**

When pulsations are synchronized, the most valuable property emerges: **order**. Order does not depend on “my clock”; it depends on a shared sequence that allows one to say:

- “this event fell on pulse N,”  
- “this other event fell on pulse N+1.”

This transforms the problem from “what time was it?” to “at what position in the sequence did it occur?”

---

### **1.5 From continuous to discrete: infinite sequence**

#### **1.5.1 Conceptual discretization of time: from continuous flow to pulse counting**

Continuous time is difficult to operate in discrete systems (computation, records, auditing). Pulsation enables discretization: converting continuity into **indices**. Counting creates a structure where each mark can be enumerated.

This discretization does not deny continuity; it makes it operable.

#### **1.5.2 Chain model: each pulse preceded and followed by another (the “Z…” metaphor)**

I describe the idea as an infinite chain: each pulse has a previous one and a next one, without end. My “Z…” metaphor expresses exactly that: a succession that never exhausts, always continuing backward and forward.

This infinite sequence is the theoretical basis of a **total order by succession**: if two events fall on different pulses, I can order them.

#### **1.5.3 Emergent property: total order by succession**

If the sequence is strictly successive, order emerges as an emergent property:

- every pulse N precedes pulse N+1,  
- there is no ambiguity of precedence within the sequence.

The sequence does not tell me what happened, but it provides the **frame to order what happened**.

---

### **1.6 Granularity: from the human standard to the quantum horizon**

#### **1.6.1 Practical human unit: the second as a cultural/technological reference**

The technological world adopted the second as a practical unit. I acknowledge that fact as a human and operational reference: it is a scale at which interfaces, protocols, and everyday systems are designed.

In this Point 1, the second is only an example of **standard granularity**, not a protocol commitment.

#### **1.6.2 Smaller scales: the idea of sub-second as measurement refinement**

Conceptually, a pulsation system can be refined: if I can count faster pulses, I obtain more resolution. This refinement does not change the theory; it changes granularity.

The conceptual rule is: **the greater the stability and verifiability, the greater the useful granularity**.

#### **1.6.3 Quantum horizon: Planck as a reference for a theoretical limit**

There is discourse about theoretical physical limits (such as the Planck scale). I take it here as a **conceptual horizon**: a reminder that there are limits to what can have physical meaning. I do not use it as dogma or as an implementation promise.

Strictly speaking: theory admits a horizon; engineering decides what is viable.

#### **1.6.4 Principle: a functional quantum measurement must be defined by applicable science**

My position (LAEV) is clear: any mention of extreme scales must remain a conceptual reference and **not** mysticism. A useful theory does not rely on the unattainable as an argument from authority; it relies on what is definable, measurable, and verifiable.

---

### **1.7 The current problem this theory aims to solve (without discussing implementation yet)**

#### **1.7.1 Lack of a common temporal pattern across heterogeneous systems**

The root problem is the absence of an accepted common pattern across multiple systems: networks, devices, platforms, and industrial domains. Each actor “marks” time, but those marks are not naturally compatible.

#### **1.7.2 Event disorder: ambiguity about “when it happened”**

In distributed environments, disorder is not always physical; it is **epistemic**. I do not know which event precedes which, because records cannot be ordered without disputes. When order is disputable, auditing weakens.

#### **1.7.3 Impact on IoT, automation, auditing, and coordination**

When coordination depends on “when,” ambiguity generates:

- record discrepancies,  
- operational causality conflicts,  
- compliance disputes,  
- fragility in traceability.

I postulate that a common pulsation theory reduces the space of ambiguity—not because it “magically synchronizes everything,” but because it defines a discrete temporal language susceptible to consensus.

---

### **1.8 Postulates of Point 1 (theoretical axioms)**

#### **1.8.1 Axiom of pulse constancy**

There exists a theoretical pulsation whose base property is **constancy**: the pulse represents a stable repetition that can serve as a reference for counting.

#### **1.8.2 Axiom of location independence**

The validity of the pulse does not depend on the observer’s location. If the reference changes by location, it ceases to be universal.

#### **1.8.3 Axiom of infinite sequence and total order**

Pulses form an infinite and strictly successive sequence. From that succession emerges a **total order** among pulses.

#### **1.8.4 Axiom of extensible granularity**

The theory admits that granularity can be refined without breaking the model, as long as constancy and verifiability are preserved.

---

### **1.9 Closing and transition**

#### **1.9.1 What is demonstrated conceptually**

In this Point 1 it is established—as my idea (LAEV)—that:

- useful time for technological systems must not depend on cultural labels,  
- a constant pulsation model allows discretization of continuity,  
- the pulse sequence provides a frame of order,  
- conceptual pulse synchronization is the logical foundation for a common time.

#### **1.9.2 Bridge to Point 2**

Point 2 builds on this foundation to answer the inevitable question: **how this theory is operationalized** in a real temporal-consensus system without falling into ambiguity, and how it becomes a functional structure for coordination and auditing among actors.
