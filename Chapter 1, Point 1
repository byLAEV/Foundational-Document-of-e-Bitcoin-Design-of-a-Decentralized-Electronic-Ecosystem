## **Chapter 1 — Point 1**

### **Infinite Constant Pulsations (Theoretical Framework)**

---

### **1.0 Purpose and Scope**

#### **1.0.1 What I intend to demonstrate in this point**

I, **Lerry Alexander Elizondo Villalobos (byLAEV)**, establish here the **theoretical framework** that supports my proposal: the idea of **synchronized infinite constant pulsations** as a universal way to order and measure the unfolding of events.

This Point 1 has a concrete objective: to **define and justify** why a “pulsation” model—**constant, repeatable, verifiable, and potentially synchronizable**—is a more robust foundation than the traditional notion of “date/time” for building technological systems that require temporal coordination.

#### **1.0.2 What is not addressed yet**

In this point I do **not** develop any implementation, architecture, layer model, block structure, thresholds, future windows, operational calendars, governance, or network mechanisms. Everything related to “how it is operationalized” is reserved for **Point 2**. Here I present only the theory and its postulates.

---

### **1.1 How time works today (current technological view)**

#### **1.1.1 Time as measurement: clocks, timestamps, and imperfect synchronization**

In modern practice, technological time is represented as **measurement**: physical clocks, logical clocks, periodic signals, counters, and **timestamps**. These systems produce temporal markers intended to describe “when something happened.”

However, real infrastructure operates with **inevitable misalignments**: oscillator drift, network latency, jitter, losses, reordering, and reference differences across systems. This means two observers can assign different temporal marks to the same event, even if both believe they are measuring “the same time.”

#### **1.1.2 Why “measuring time” is not the same as “having a common time”**

Measuring time produces a local reading; having a common time requires **consensus** about the order and/or correspondence of measurements. In distributed systems, what matters is not the elegance of a clock, but the ability to **compare** marks across heterogeneous actors without ambiguity.

The baseline conclusion is: **local precision does not guarantee global coherence**.

#### **1.1.3 Consequences in technological networks and distributed systems**

When there is no shared temporal pattern, a transversal problem appears: **ambiguity of occurrence**.

- What happened first if clocks disagree?  
- What does “at the same time” mean between nodes with different latencies?  
- How do I audit a process if records are not strictly orderable under a universal criterion?

This Point 1 begins from that observation: traditional time is sufficient for local use, but insufficient when **globally verifiable order** is required.

---

### **1.2 My conceptual framework: infinite three-dimensional space**

#### **1.2.1 Infinite three-dimensional space as the baseline scenario**

The origin of my idea (LAEV) comes from a conceptual exercise: I imagine myself at the **center of an infinite three-dimensional space**, with no privileged external references. In that scenario, nothing “tells” me where the system begins or ends, because the frame is unlimited.

That exercise forces me to separate two things that are usually confused:

- the **stage** where events occur (space),  
- and the **rhythm** by which events become distinguishable as a sequence (time).

#### **1.2.2 Time as a constant field: the continuous flow that does not stop**

In my framework, time is not an object that “appears” when there are events. Time is a **constant field**: it exists regardless of the density of occurrences. The universe can be “empty” of events relevant to me, yet the temporal field continues.

What varies is not time; what varies is the **occupation of time by events**.

#### **1.2.3 What changes is not time: events, trajectory, and density of occurrences change**

If the stage is infinite, then the reference cannot depend on a location, a time zone, a local authority, or an isolated clock. What I can measure with practical utility is not “absolute time,” but the **regularity of a pattern** that allows ordering of events.

That is why my focus shifts from “date/time” to “rhythm”: a constant rhythm is a more neutral base.

#### **1.2.4 Slow-motion analogy: constant time, variable facts**

A metaphor I use (and I sign as my idea) is slow motion: a camera can record at different rates, but the underlying phenomenon does not change. Thus, measurements can distort perception, while the temporal field maintains continuity.

This analogy is not intended as physics; it is editorial and conceptual: to **separate the constancy of time from the variability of events**.

---

### **1.3 Origin of the idea: pulsation as a universal unit**

#### **1.3.1 Why a constant pulse is more fundamental than a date/time**

A date/time is a **cultural and administrative label**. A constant pulse is a **repeatable counting unit**. The difference is critical: labels depend on conventions; pulses depend on **regularity**.

I propose that, as a theoretical base, the pulse is more fundamental because:

- it can repeat indefinitely,  
- it can be counted without external semantics,  
- it can serve as a building block for higher units without “interpretation.”

#### **1.3.2 Pulsation as a repeatable mark independent of location**

In my definition, a pulsation is a **discrete mark** of a continuous pattern. It does not depend on a place, a civil calendar, or an authority. It depends on the existence of a **periodic** phenomenon and on multiple observers being able to agree on its count.

Location-independence is the structural requirement: if my temporal base depends on “where I am,” I have already lost universality.

#### **1.3.3 Premise: if identical pulsers exist in a distributed setting, their pattern is universal**

My theoretical premise (LAEV) is: if multiple observers possess equivalent pulsers and can verify their constancy, then the pulsation pattern is a candidate for a **universal reference**.

I do not claim here how it is verified in a real network. I only state the principle: **universality arises from the pattern, not from the observer**.

---

### **1.4 Synchronization theory: synchronized constant pulsations**

#### **1.4.1 What it means to synchronize pulsations**

Synchronizing pulsations, in a theoretical sense, means different observers can:

1. recognize the same type of pulse, and  
2. align pulse counting under a shared criterion.

It is not necessary to assume “a single clock.” It is sufficient that a conceptual procedure exists such that the pulse becomes **comparable**.

#### **1.4.2 Stability condition: repetition, constancy, and verifiability**

For a pulsation system to be useful as a temporal base, it must meet three conditions:

- **Repetition:** the pulse must always occur.  
- **Constancy:** its interval must be stable enough not to break counting.  
- **Verifiability:** some (theoretical) criterion must exist to detect deviations.

In this Point 1, “verifiability” is a logical requirement, not an implementation recipe.

#### **1.4.3 Synchronization as the basis for order and coordination among observers**

When pulsations are synchronized, the most valuable property emerges: **order**. Order does not depend on “my clock”; it depends on a shared sequence that allows one to say:

- “this event fell on pulse N,”  
- “this other event fell on pulse N+1.”

This transforms the problem from “what time was it?” to “at what position in the sequence did it occur?”

### **1.5 From continuous to discrete: infinite sequence**

#### **1.5.1 Conceptual discretization of time: from continuous flow to pulse counting**

Continuous time is difficult to operate in discrete systems (computation, records, auditing). Pulsation enables discretization: converting continuity into **indices**. Counting creates a structure where each mark can be enumerated.

This discretization does not deny continuity; it makes it operable.

#### **1.5.2 Chain model: each pulse preceded and followed by another (the “Z…” metaphor)**

I describe the idea as an infinite chain: each pulse has a previous one and a next one, without end. My “Z…” metaphor expresses exactly that: a succession that never exhausts, always continuing backward and forward.

This infinite sequence is the theoretical basis of a **total order by succession**: if two events fall on different pulses, I can order them.

#### **1.5.3 Emergent property: total order by succession**

If the sequence is strictly successive, order emerges as an emergent property:

- every pulse N precedes pulse N+1,  
- there is no ambiguity of precedence within the sequence.

The sequence does not tell me what happened, but it provides the **frame to order what happened**.

---

### **1.6 Granularity: from the human standard to the quantum horizon**

#### **1.6.1 Practical human unit: the second as a cultural/technological reference**

The technological world adopted the second as a practical unit. I acknowledge that fact as a human and operational reference: it is a scale at which interfaces, protocols, and everyday systems are designed.

In this Point 1, the second is only an example of **standard granularity**, not a protocol commitment.

#### **1.6.2 Smaller scales: the idea of sub-second as measurement refinement**

Conceptually, a pulsation system can be refined: if I can count faster pulses, I obtain more resolution. This refinement does not change the theory; it changes granularity.

The conceptual rule is: **the greater the stability and verifiability, the greater the useful granularity**.

#### **1.6.3 Quantum horizon: Planck as a reference for a theoretical limit**

There is discourse about theoretical physical limits (such as the Planck scale). I take it here as a **conceptual horizon**: a reminder that there are limits to what can have physical meaning. I do not use it as dogma or as an implementation promise.

Strictly speaking: theory admits a horizon; engineering decides what is viable.

#### **1.6.4 Principle: a functional quantum measurement must be defined by applicable science**

My position (LAEV) is clear: any mention of extreme scales must remain a conceptual reference and **not** mysticism. A useful theory does not rely on the unattainable as an argument from authority; it relies on what is definable, measurable, and verifiable.

---

### **1.7 The current problem this theory aims to solve (without discussing implementation yet)**

#### **1.7.1 Lack of a common temporal pattern across heterogeneous systems**

The root problem is the absence of an accepted common pattern across multiple systems: networks, devices, platforms, and industrial domains. Each actor “marks” time, but those marks are not naturally compatible.

#### **1.7.2 Event disorder: ambiguity about “when it happened”**

In distributed environments, disorder is not always physical; it is **epistemic**. I do not know which event precedes which, because records cannot be ordered without disputes. When order is disputable, auditing weakens.

#### **1.7.3 Impact on IoT, automation, auditing, and coordination**

When coordination depends on “when,” ambiguity generates:

- record discrepancies,  
- operational causality conflicts,  
- compliance disputes,  
- fragility in traceability.

I postulate that a common pulsation theory reduces the space of ambiguity—not because it “magically synchronizes everything,” but because it defines a discrete temporal language susceptible to consensus.

### **1.8 Postulates of Point 1 (theoretical axioms)**

#### **1.8.1 Axiom of pulse constancy**

There exists a theoretical pulsation whose base property is **constancy**: the pulse represents a stable repetition that can serve as a reference for counting.

#### **1.8.2 Axiom of location independence**

The validity of the pulse does not depend on the observer’s location. If the reference changes by location, it ceases to be universal.

#### **1.8.3 Axiom of infinite sequence and total order**

Pulses form an infinite and strictly successive sequence. From that succession emerges a **total order** among pulses.

#### **1.8.4 Axiom of extensible granularity**

The theory admits that granularity can be refined without breaking the model, as long as constancy and verifiability are preserved.

---

### **1.9 Closing and transition**

#### **1.9.1 What is demonstrated conceptually**

In this Point 1 it is established—as my idea (LAEV)—that:

- useful time for technological systems must not depend on cultural labels,  
- a constant pulsation model allows discretization of continuity,  
- the pulse sequence provides a frame of order,  
- conceptual pulse synchronization is the logical foundation for a common time.

#### **1.9.2 Bridge to Point 2**

Point 2 builds on this foundation to answer the inevitable question: **how this theory is operationalized** in a real temporal-consensus system without falling into ambiguity, and how it becomes a functional structure for coordination and auditing among actors.
